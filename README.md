# Software-Project---Game-of-Life
This program is an implementation of "Conways Game of Life" with different features.
For example you can change the rules, symbols of dead and living cells etc.
When you start the program, there are different settings that have to be filled:

"Enter symbol for living cells:" - How should living cells be illustrated? Only one character!
"Enter symbol for dead cells:" - How should dead cells be illustrated? Only one character!
"Enter x-axis value:" - How many cells should exist in one row? Only numbers!
"Enter y-axis value:" - How many cells should exist in one column? Only numbers!
"Enter percentage:" - Used for the first iteration, which is generated random with that percentage. Only integer!
"1 for automatic mode:" - Should the iterations be generated automatically or manually?
"Seconds between Iterations:" - Only relevant for automatic iterations. How long should the break between iterations be?
"1 to Change Rules:" - Should the ruleset be changed?
"Cells die, if number of neighbors more than:" - Number, when cells should die.
"Cells die, if number of neighbors less than:" - Number, when cells should die.
"New cells are born if number of living neighbors is:" - At how many neighbors should dead cells gain life?

If you want to export the state, then you have to press "1" between iterations in the manual process.
